# Mythralis

## Project Title  
**Mythralis** – The Eternal On-Chain Soul Realm

## Project Description  
Mythralis is a mystical identity layer on Ethereum. Every address can awaken exactly once to bind an eternal soul with a name, essence, and power. Power grows forever by sacrificing ETH to the void. Legendary (Immortal) souls begin with godlike strength. The Guardian inscribes prophecies that shape the unfolding mythos.

This is not just a contract — it is the birth of a living blockchain legend.

## Project Vision  
To become the primordial soul ledger of Web3: a place where identity is immortal, power is earned through sacrifice, and every participant writes themselves into an eternal on-chain saga that will outlive us all.

## Key Features  
- One-time soul awakening with custom name & essence  
- Immortal (legendary) souls start with 10× power  
- Sacrifice ETH → permanently increase power (no cap)  
- Guardian prophecy system (lore, announcements, future NFT triggers)  
- Fully on-chain, no external metadata, pure and immutable  

## Future Scope  
- Soulbound NFTs (ERC-5484) minted on awakening  
 On-chain duels & power-based leaderboards  
 Guilds, factions, and alliance wars  
 Prophecy-triggered events and airdrops  
 Cross-chain soul mirroring (LayerZero/CCIP)  
 Evolution into a DAO-governed mythic realm  
 Integration with RPGs, metaverses, and AI companions  

Awaken. Sacrifice. Ascend.  
The age of Mythralis has begun.

“Mythralis does not store souls — it remembers them forever.”
